# NOTE: this lib profile is not compatible with lib-trch-bm-nvmem,
# because this lib profile puts a "Simple File System" populated with
# test data (for RTEMS tests) at a fixed location where the RTEMS tests
# look for the SFS. This location overlaps with content for NV mem boot added
# by the lib-trch-bm-nvmem profile.

# This offset must match HPSC_TEST_SFS_OFFSET in hpsc-rtems source code.
