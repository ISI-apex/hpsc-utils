# This test measures the load on the system after running the NAS EP benchmark
# with a specified number of OpenMP threads for a specified number of seconds.
# If "num_threads" is assigned a value of "0", then the EP benchmark won't be
# run.  As a result, only the load resulting from running QEMU will be measured.
#
# Note that this test should not be called by default since the filename does not
# begin with the word "test".  If the test is called explicitly, make sure to
# pass the "-s" flag to view the stdout generated during the test, e.g:
#
# pytest -sv --host hpscqemu --durations=0 measure_load.py

# Finally, make sure that the CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR env var is set.  This is the
# directory where the hpsc-bsp directory is located.  On AWS CodeBuild, this is
# done automatically.  In any other environment, it needs to be set.
