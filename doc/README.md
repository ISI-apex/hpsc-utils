Guide to HPSC Source Release
============================

Ultra-condensed Quick-start
---------------------------

This section gives a very condensed summary of quickest way to get from an
extracted HPSC Source Release (or a cloned HPSC parent repository) to a BusyBox
prompt on HPPS Linux running in Qemu emulator on CentOS 7 (run as a user with
access to `sudo`, but not as `root`) -- takes about 5 minutes:

    $ source env.sh
    $ make sdk/deps/centos7
    $ make sdk
    $ source env.sh
    $ make ssw/prof/sys-preload-trch-bm-hpps-busybox/run/qemu

In another terminal connect to the target serial port:

    $ screen -r hpsc-0-hpps

Please do read the sections below for complete instructions. The instructions
include information for how to run on other Linux distributions, including
without root acccess, how to run in other target HW emulators, how to boot into
other target configuration profiles (e.g., boot from non-volatile memory, boot
Yocto Linux, etc), and other important information.

Setup environment
=================

You may want or need to do some of the following one-time setup.

The Makefiles for HPSC stack require the Bash shell. Check the shell
on your server with `ls -l /bin/sh` and if it is not `*/bash`, then
run the following to point make to bash (also, make sure bash shell
is installed on your system; if you don't have root, you can probably
build it from source and use the absolute path to your build instead of
`/bin/bash` in the command below):

    $ echo 'alias make="make SHELL=/bin/bash"' >> .hpscrc

You may observe hangs or delays (up to minutes) with CPU utilization
during builds of HPSC SSW, during the steps that involve building initramfs
images with `fakeroot`. This issue seems to be due to buggy `faked-tcp`
(observed in fakeroot v1.24 on multiple distributions). To prevent this issue,
switch from the TCP to the SYSV variant of fakeroot using the `alternatives`
system (on CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu), as root:

   # update-alternatives --set fakeroot /usr/bin/fakeroot-sysv

For users of the `vim` editor, to apply syntax highlighting to some of
the custom config files, add to your `~/.vimrc`:

    au BufRead,BufNewFile *.mem.map setfiletype sh

Load the HPSC environment into the shell
========================================

The HPSC environment file sets up some useful configuration, e.g.  sets all
invocations of make to be parallel by default, allows the the remote clone of
the source repository to be accessed by multiple users when cloned by file path
on an online server, loads the per-working-copy config, loads the HPSC SDK if
it is built.

Every time you want to work on the HPSC in a new shell, start a Bash shell and
load the HPSC environment (also, make sure your environment is clean -- ensure
that no environment files been loaded):

    $ cd hpsc
    $ bash
    $ source env.sh

Do not configure your shell to load this environment automatically (e.g. via
`~/.bashrc`) because it will pollute your environment potentially breaking
other work not related to HPSC.

Build the HPSC SDK
==================

To build and run software for the target, you need the SDK for the HPSC
Chiplet. The HPSC SDK provides tools needed to build, run, and debug software
on the HPSC Chiplet hardware; as well as the Qemu emulator for the Chiplet and
tools to run on other emulators. Using the HSPC SDK, you may build and run the
HPSC System Software stack or develop your custom software stack.

The HPSC SDK is distributed in (mostly) source within the HPSC source release
tarball, and is also a module in the parent repository. Both origins ship both
the SDK and the HPSC System Software Stack together. The SDK components are
built in-place within its source tree.

Provide the HPSC SDK dependencies
---------------------------------

Before the HPSC SDK can be built from source, install its dependencies by take
**one** of the following paths:

* Option A: packages installed into the host system (requires root privilege)
* Option B: dependencies built from source to compose a sysroot

If you have root access to the machine, then Option A is recommended.

### Option A: dependencies installed in the system

Follow this option to prepare to build the SDK against libraries and tools
installed in the system (i.e. from the OS distribution's packages).

Distributions on which the installation was successfully done (not all are
officially supported):
* `centos7`: CentOS 7
* `arch`: Arch Linux

First, ensure that your user has sudo priviledge. On Cent OS and on Arch
distributions, it is enough to add the user to the `wheel` group and
re-login for it to take effect:

    # usermod -a -G wheel USERNAME

Optionally, to allow running `sudo` without prompting password, run `sudo
visudo` and uncomment the following line:

    %wheel  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

To install the necessary packages into your host system, run the following
target replacing `DISTRO` with the identifier for your distribution from above
(run as normal user, not via sudo, sub-commands will be invoked via sudo
automatically):

    $ make sdk/deps/DISTRO

In case you need to repeat this step, clean it with the following before
repeating the above:

    $ make sdk/deps/clean

### Option B: dependencies from a sysroot built from source

Follow this option to prepare to build the SDK against a sysroot built
from source. This option may be used on any distribution without root access --
however, manual fixing may be required if the sysroot fails to build on your
system out of the box (untested territory, by definition).  This sysroot is not
a complete sysroot -- it does rely on some most basic libraries and tools in
the system, but those are expected to be present on most Linux systems.

This section provides instructions on how to use the custom sysroot builder
shipped in the HPSC SDK to build the sysroot.

If the machine is offline without internet access, and if the HPSC source
release you have did not ship the sysroot source tarballs (check
`sdk/sysroot/bld/fetch`), then first fetch the source archives on a machine
with internet acccess, and copy the folling directories to the same paths in
the working copy of the source tree on the offline machine (in this example
using Rsync over SSH):

	online_host$ cd hpsc
	online_host$ make sdk/sysroot/fetch
	online_host$ rsync -aq sdk/sysroot/bld/fetch/ offline_host:/path/to/hpsc/sdk/sysroot/bld/fetch/

To build the sysroot and set it up as dependency for the SDK:

	$ make sdk/deps/sysroot

Re-load the environment to load the sysroot into the shell:

        $ source env.sh

#### Troubleshooting the sysroot

Should any components fail to build, these tips may be helpful.

Individual components can be built from top level by name; names are intuitive,
with dashes replaced by underscores, defined in `DEPS_*` vars in
`sdk/hpsc-sdk-tools/sysroot/Makefile`:

	$ cd sdk/hpsc-sdk-tools/sysroot/COMPONENT/clean
	$ cd sdk/hpsc-sdk-tools/sysroot/COMPONENT

Or, having navigated to the sysroot builder `sdk/hpsc-sdk-tools/sysroot`:

		$ make COMPONENT/clean
		$ make COMPONENT

The clean here wipes the build directory entirely.

To diagnose failures examine/edit the recipe for any component in `Makefile`.
You can also navigate to the component's build directory
`bld/work/COMPONENT_DIR`, modify sources, and re-run the make command at the
top level for an incremental rebuild.

Prepare an offline build
------------------------

The HPSC SDK includes some components whose source is shipped within the SDK,
and other external components whose source is fetched from upstream release
point and which are then built from source.

If the host on which you want to build the HPSC SDK is offline (cannot reach
the Internet), then you have to obtain the source tarballs somehow. The HPSC
source release may contain the source tarballs for external components, but if
you have cloned from Git, then follow the instructins in this section to fetch 
the components on an online host and transfer them to the offline host.

	online_host$ cd hpsc
	online_host$ make sdk/fetch
	online_host$ rsync -aq sdk/bld/fetch/ offline_host:/path/to/hpsc/sdk/bld/fetch/

Build the HPSC SDK
------------------

Ensure that the HPSC environment has been loaded into the shell (see above).

To build the HPSC SDK from source, in place within the source tree:

    $ make sdk

If you want to use networking via TUN/TAP devices, you need access to `sudo`
for root privileges to run the following installation target (run this target
as normal user, `sudo` will be invoked on demand):

    $ make sdk/qemu/install

### Troubleshoot HPSC SDK build

Components of the HPSC SDK can be cleaned and re-built individually on demand,
using targets that correspond to files and folders in the build directory tree
or the source directory tree. To rebuilt a target, append `/clean` to the
target, e.g. to rebuild the `env` target: `make env/clean && make env`. Summary
of targets:

* `qemu` (or `bld/qemu`): build and install Qemu emulator (out-of-tree)
* the target for a component built in-place is its source directory path:
  `hpsc-sdk-tools`, `qemu-devicetrees`
* the target for a component built out-of-tree is its build directory path:
  `bld/qemu` (this particular one is also aliased to `qemu`)
* `bld/sysroot/opt/bintc`: extract binary toolchains; to rebuild an individual
   toolchain, append its subdirectory followed by `/clean`
* `bld/extern`: build components fetched and built from source; to clean a
   component append its subdirectory followed by `/clean`; to extract only
   make the subdirectory target, to trigger build, make `bld/extern/COMPONENT`,
   where COMPONENT is the name without the version, e.g. `gdb`.
* `env` : generate environment file for loading the SDK into the shell

The SDK installs pre-compiled binary toolchains distributed by ARM/Linaro.
On hosts which are very old, with a glibc older than the one the toolchains
were linked against, the SDK builder will build a mini-sysroot with the
glibc built from source, and relocate the toolchain binaries to it. This will
happen automatically based on libc version detection, but for trouleshooting
the relevant targets are:

* `bld/bintc-sysroot`: build the mini-sysroot with a recent glibc
* `bld/sysroot/opt/bintc/TOOLCHAIN_SUBDIR/relocate`: perform relocation of
  the given toolchain

Load the HPSC SDK
-----------------

Re-load the HPSC environment to load the newly built SDK:

    $ source env.sh

Build the HPSC System Software Stack for the Chiplet target
===========================================================

Make sure you have loaded the HPSC SDK into your current shell (see above).

Change to the directory of the HSPC System Software Stack:

	$ cd ssw

The HPSC SSW stack can be built in one of several configuration profiles.  List
the available configuration profiles, and their descriptions, runnable profiles
are prefixed with `sys-`:

	$ make
	$ make desc

To list only runnable profiles:

	$ make list/sys
	$ make desc/sys

Pick a desired profile from the list, say `sys-preload-hpps-busybox` which
has the emulator preload the TRCH SSW bare-metal application into TRCH on-chip
SRAM and binaries for the HPPS stack into HPPS DRAM, then boots TRCH into the
SSW bare-metal application, and lets TRCH boot HPPS into Busybox on Linux via
Arm Trusted Firware and U-boot bootloader.

In the following commands, instead of the symbolic string `PROFILE`, subsitute
the name of the selected, profile, like `sys-preload-hpps-busybox`. Storing the
profile name in an environment variable is generally not advantageous, because
after the first build of the profile, paths in the file system will exist, and
autocomplete on target strings will work. If you do use shell environment
variables, do not use `$PROF` since this name is reserved in the Makefile.

To build the profile incrementally, invoking nested builds:

	$ make prof/PROFILE

Deeply clean a profile (invokes clean on nested modules too):

	$ make prof/PROFILE/clean

Shallowly clean only the artifacts in `prof/PROFILE/bld/` (does not invoke
clean within the nested modules):

	$ make prof/PROFILE/bld/clean

## Switch between profiles

When working on multiple profiles, must be taken when building (and running)
then one after another.

After having built/run a profile X, before building/running a profile Y, you
must issue the shallow profile clean:

	$ make prof/PROFILE_X
	$ make prof/PROFILE_Y/bld/clean
	$ make prof/PROFILE_Y

The clean is necessary because the nested build artifacts built during the
build of X may be newer than the profile config files of profile Y that they
also depend on. If the target artifact is newer than its prerequisites, then
the artifact will not get rebuilt, so at the end of the build of profile Y,
some artifacts would still reflect the configuration of X. This is relevant
only when X and Y change the config of the artifact, but the clean step
should just be done in all cases, it doesn't cost anything.

## Invoke parts of the build explicitly

Invoke incremental nested build on a particular nested module (invokes only
strictly the nested build, does not rebuild artifacts in `prof/PROFILE/bld/`):

    $ make prof/PROFILE/bld/hpps/linux

Clean a module (invoke the nested build: only cleans artifacts within the
module's nested source tree, does not clean artifacts in `prof/PROFILE/bld/`):

    $ make prof/PROFILE/bld/hpps/linux/clean

Build a non-nested artifact individually -- any artifact in the
`prof/PROFILE/bld/` can be rebuilt this way, but not artifacts that are within
the source trees of the nested modules (e.g. inside `hpps/linux/`), since the
nested dependency tree is opaque to the top-level dependency tree:

	$ make prof/PROFILE/bld/trch/syscfg.bin

## Control the depth of the build

All builds are incremental, and will only rebuild artifacts that are missing
or out of date with respect to their dependencies. However, dependency
trees of the nested modules are not visible to the the top-level (this is not
feasible, nor sensible, since nested build systems might not even be based on
make!). Therefore, to incrementally build an artifact that depends on an
source or artifact a the nested module, the nested build must be invoked.

When the nested build system is designed well, it will do nothing or very
little when invoked on a completed build, however in practice some may
take a while to run, and may even rebuild artifacts for no reason. This is
still fast, though, and may be ignored, but to eliminate this wasted time,
the top-level build may be explicitly instructed to be shallow, i.e. not invoke
the nested build, at the risk of artifacts not being rebuilt when they
should and would have in a normal deep build.

To control the depth of the build, set `DEEP` (alias `D`) or `SHALLOW` (alias
`S`) variable to a pattern that matches names of nested module, where `%` is
the wildcard, and value `1` matches everything (equivalent to value `%`) and
`0` matches nothing.  For example, all of the following will prevent (at least)
the nested build in HPPS U-boot source tree from being invoked:

	$ make bld/PROFILE S=1
	$ make bld/PROFILE S=hpps-uboot
	$ make bld/PROFILE S=hpps-%

Only set a build to be shallow when you know that the artifacts produced by the
nested build in question did not change.

## Peudo out-of-tree build of nested modules

By default, a nested module is built in place, in the module's souce tree.
This is desirable, because it supports the edit, build, run development loop,
including unrestricted usage of the nested build system directly (without
the top-level), as needed for example for `make menuconfig` in Linux. Also,
this allows profiles (that do not change the compile-time configuration of the
module) to seemlessly share the build.

However, for some rare use cases, it is possible to build a module quasi out of
tree, without relying on out-of-tree build supprot from the module's build
system (rarely available). The top-level builder supports optional
"privatization" of the source tree of a nested module, by coping the nested
module's source tree (from its usual location) into the profile's private build
directory, cleaning it (because the copy will pickup build outputs, not
possible to exclude in a generic way), and building the module there.

To build a profile in privatized mode (privatizes the set of modules used by
the profile):

	$ make PRIV=1 prof/PROFILE

Making use of the out-of-tree build feature of modules to implement the
out-of-tree build option for the profile is not implemented, but would be nice.

Currently, privatization is only used for special profiles of type "tool",
which are used to produce artifacts that require invoking the emulator and
running the target software stack (e.g. to translate an ftrace dump).
Privatization may be useful in the testing context, to build multiple profiles
in the build step, and then run them in the run-test step (otherwise, the test
step will have to perform a build if more than one profile is to be tested).

Run a SSW stack profile on a target platform
=============================================

Currently supported target HPSC Chiplet platforms (conceptually, boards) are:
* `qemu`: Qemu, a software emulator (shipped in the HSPCC SDK)
* `zebu`: Synopsys FPGA-based emulator (to use it, you need to get the HPSC
software stack source release of the `zebu` branch, which contains an
expanded HPSC SDK with `sdk/zebu` module, and you need to build and run the SSW
stack on the specific Synopsys SCS server).

In the followin commands, replace the `PLATFORM` string with one of the
platforms in the above list.

To run a profile on a target platform:

	$ make prof/PROFILE/run/PLATFORM

You may also pass arguments to the launch script via `ARGS` variable. For
example, to launch Qemu in the GDB debugger, and wait for attachment:

	$ make prof/PROFILE/run/qemu ARGS="-S gdb"

Invoking the above run target also invokes:
* the incremental build of the profile -- so in edit-build-run
  development loop, after modifying source code, it is sufficient to
  invoke only this run target (with the exception of when switching between
  profiles, which requires a shallow clean step -- see an earlier section).
* a build of artifacts needed to run on the given platform (e.g. memory
  images in the platform-specific format, CLI arguments, etc); these
  artifacts can be cleaned and re-built explicitly via:

		$ make prof/PROFILE/bld/PLATFORM/clean
		$ make prof/PROFILE/bld/PLATFORM

Non-volatile state of the target machine (e.g. contents of non-volaitile
off-chip memories) will persist across runs, until you explicitly clean the run
state, either for a given platform:

	$ make prof/PROFILE/run/PLATFORM/clean

Or, for all platforms:

	$ make prof/PROFILE/run/clean

The configuration files related to running profiles on platforms are
defined by the `platform` profile (in `ssw/hpsc-utils/prof/platform/`).
The files there are consumed to produce profile-specific configuration
files in `prof/PROFILE/bld`.

All platforms are configured via a generic cross-platform memory map file
that describes which blobs are loaded into which memories at which addresses:

	$ cat prof/PROFILE/bld/preload.mem.map

Also, the platforms consume a configuration file with memory parameters,
that is merged from a cross-platform base configuration with platform-specific
overriding overlays on top:

	$ cat prof/PROFILE/bld/PLATFORM/mem.ini

Each platform consumes a configuration in this generic format and builds
memory images and other platform-specific configuration, like command line
arguments in `prof/PROFILE/bld/PLATFORM/`.

## Run a profile in Qemu

Build the and run the selected profile in Qemu, in one command:

    $ make prof/PROFILE/run/qemu

In a different shell (also will SDK environment loaded!) connect to the serial
console screen session printed when Qemu runs.

Use a separate shell for each serial port (and make sure that each shell
has the SDK environment loaded into it!), for HPPS:

    $ screen -r hpsc-0-hpps

Default names of the screen sessions for each serial port on the Chiplet are:

	* `hpsc-0-lsio0`: LSIO UART #0 (used by TRCH in the SSW Stack)
	* `hpsc-0-lsio1`: LSIO UART #1 (used by RTPS in the SSW stack)
	* `hpsc-0-hpps`: HPPS UART

To terminate the target, in the shell where Qemu was run via
`prof/PROFILE/run/qemu`, at the `(qemu)` monitor prompt (press enter if you do
not see the prompt):

    (qemu) quit

The platform-specific artifacts for Qemu in `prof/PROFILE/bld/qemu` are:

* `preload.mem.map.args`: command line arguments for loading data into memories,
  generated from a generic cross-platform specification in
  `bld/PROFILE/preload.mem.map`
* `*.mem.bin`: images for non-volatile memory (generated from same map
  specification), if not mentioned in the map, then a blank image is created.
* `env.sh`: parameters for `launch-qemu` script (specifies network ports, etc.)

## Run a profile in the Synopsis Zebu emulator

This will only work when you got the HPSC release, built it, and are running,
all on the specific Synopsys SCS server.

Build the and run the selected profile in Zebu, in one command:

    $ make prof/PROFILE/run/zebu

To not launch the emulator automatically upon startup and instead use
the `run` command manually (see below):

	$ make prof/PROFILE/run/zebu ARGS="-S"

In a different shell (also with SDK environment loaded!), connect to the serial
console on HPPS UART:

    $ screen -r zebu-uart-hpps

At the `zRci` prompt, to pause the target execution:

	% run 1

When paused, to continue running for some cycles:

    % run 10000000

To collect a trace of the program counter (PC) register, execute the following
command and hit Ctrl-C to stop tracing (the output file path is printed):

	% source hw_get_pc.ucli

To exit:

    % quit

A stackdump on exit is commonly observed. If the process fails to exit,
then send it to background with `Ctrl-Z` and kill the job:

    $ kill %1

The platform-specific artifacts for Zebu in `prof/PROFILE/bld/zebu` are:

* `*.mem.bin` or `*.mem.vhex`: memory images for each memory, with contents
  specified in the generic cross-platform specification
  `bld/PROFILE/preload.mem.map`
* `preload.zebu.mem.map`: directives for loading images into memories for Zebu
   TCL scripts

Test
====

HPSC SSW stack includes a test suite implemented using PyTest harness
that invokes Qemu and runs tests against the target software running
in it. The test harness invokes Qemu in a very similar way to the
invocation through the run target.

Each profile defines which tests it supports. Note that if the profile
does not define the set of tests at all, then the default test target
will attempt to run all tests which will fail.

To run the tests for a profile:

    make ssw/prof/PROFILE/test/qemu

To run a specific test named `TEST_NAME`:

    make ssw/prof/PROFILE/test/qemu/TEST_NAME

To run a specific set of tests selected by a PyTest filter pattern (see `-k`
argument to pytest), e.g. to choose tests in classes named `TestFoo` and
`TestBar`:

    make ssw/prof/PROFILE/test/qemu TESTS_FILTER="TestFoo or TestBar"

Test test target uses the same directory as the run target for the runtime
copies of the nonvolatile memory images. To clean this state, such that it is
re-initialized from the built artifacts use the following target (which is just
an alias to the `.../run/clean` target):

    make ssw/prof/PROFILE/test/qemu/clean


Troubleshooting
===============

This section describes some tips for diagnosing issues. For bruteforce
debugging in GDB and tracing, read the sections after this section.

Systemd boot
------------

If Linux boot fails during systemd startup, verbose log can be obtained
by passing the following boot arguments to the kernel:

    systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=console

To pass boot arguments to the kernel, append them to the `bootargs` variable in
U-boot environment file. For example, you can temporarily edit the u-boot
environment overlay in `lib-hpps-linux` profile in
`ssw/hpsc-utils/prof/lib-hpps-linux/hpps/u-boot.env` or create a separate
overlay in your profile.

Tracing
=======

Tracing in Qemu
---------------

Pass the `--trace event_id_pattern,file=/path/to/trace.tr` argument to Qemu.
For a list of available events, see a file installed when Qemu is built,
`sdk/bld/sysroot/usr/share/qemu/trace-events-all`.

To pass arguments to Qemu, they must be passed to launch-qemu script, in the
form of `cmd args...` (where `cmd` is `run` or `gdb`). To pass arguments to
`launch-qemu` via the run target described in Section [Run a profile in
qemu](#run-a-profile-in-qemu), set the `ARGS` make variable.

For example, to trace accesses to a memory-mapped region of some device:

    $ make ssw/prof/PROFILE/run/qemu ARGS="run --trace memory_region_*,file=/tmp/mem.tr"

Event list to trace may also be specified via a file: `--trace events=/tmp/file,...`.

To decode the binary trace:

    $ python2 sdk/qemu/scripts/simpletrace.py sdk/bld/sysroot/usr/share/qemu/trace-events-all /tmp/mem.tr

Debugging
=========

The profile build places binaries in ELF format with debug symbols in
the profile build directory along with the packed images for booting:

	$ find prof/sys-preload-hpps-busybox/bld -name '*.dbg.elf'

To disassemble a built binary, invoke architecture-specific objdump tool
(shipped in HPSC SDK) on the binary in ELF format:

    $ aarch64-poky-linux-objdump -D path/to/elf_binary > binary.S

The following sections describe how to use the debug binaries for two debugging
use-cases:

* debugging in GDB ***with multi-arch*** support (shipped in the HPSC SDK),
* ARM Development Studio IDE

## Debugging code running in Qemu using GDB

The HPSC SDK and with SDK environment loaded into the shell, start `gdb` on one
of the ELF binaries corresponding to code that you know has been loaded into
target memory and is executable:

	$ gdb prof/PROFILE/bld/hpps/linux/linux.dbg.elf

### Attaching to Qemu with GDB

Depending on the version of Qemu, the instructions differ. The current
supported version is v2.x.

First, launch Qemu with an argument telling it to wait for a debugger
connection instead of resetting the machine immediately:

    $ make prof/PROFILE/run/qemu ARGS="-S"

Then spot the GDB port printed in the output (your port number will differ):

    GDB_PORT = 3032

#### Attaching to Qemu v2.x

Qemu v2.x supports attaching the debugger to only one of the processor clusters
in the machine, for a given build of Qemu. To attach to a different CPU
cluster, you need to rebuild Qemu, passing the desired cluster index to the
configure script. Furthermore, since profiles generate machine configurations
with different sets of clusters (e.g. HPPS A53x8 only, without RTPS R52, etc),
to debug different profiles, may require rebuilding Qemu. To rebuild Qemu
for a cluster at index `INDEX`:

    $ make sdk/qemu/clean/all
    $ make QEMU_GDB_TARGET_CLUSTER=INDEX sdk/qemu

To get the cluster index, count in the following list starting at 0 and
skipping any clusters that your profile does not enable:

    TRCH
    RTPS R52
    RTPS A53
    HPPS A53

For example, if your profile instantiates only TRCH and HPPS A53 cluster
and you want to debug code on the HPPS A53 cluster, then `INDEX=1`.

To connect to a running Qemu instance (replace GDB_PORT with the port number
printed when Qemu is launched):

	(gdb) target remote :GDB_PORT

The following warning may be printed -- it is safe to ignore it:

    warning: Selected architecture aarch64 is not compatible with reported
        target architecture arm
    warning: Architecture rejected target-supplied description

#### Attaching to Qemu v4.x and higher

To connect to a running Qemu instance (replace GDB_PORT with the port number
printed when Qemu is launched):

	(gdb) target extended :GDB_PORT

Each clusters in the Chiplet is presented in GDB as a proceses (see GDB's
multi-process functionality), and each CPU in that cluster maps to a thread in
that process. To instantiate each cluster:

	(gdb) add-inferior # TRCH cluster
	(gdb) add-inferior # RTPS R52 cluster
	(gdb) add-inferior # RTPS A53 cluster
	(gdb) add-inferior # HPPS A53 cluster

To attach one of the above clusters, by index, e.g. for HPPS:

	(gdb) inferior 3
	(gdb) attach 3
	(gdb) info threads

### Debugging code on the target processor with GDB

Keep in mind that after attaching, the processor is still halted, so will still
be at the ATF entry point even though u-boot binary or Linux kernel binary are
loaded into the GDB debugger.

It is possible to load multiple binaries into GDB at once, but for binaries
that relocate themselves (e.g. U-boot), you need to get the relocation offset
(need to compile U-boot with debug output enabled -- TODO: provide
instructions).

To execute until entry into u-boot, set a breakpoint at the u-boot entry point:

    (gdb) break *0x80020000

To execute until entry into kernel, set a breakpoint at the kernel entry point:

    (gdb) break *0x80480000

To tell GDB to automatically display the current program counter after every step:

    (gdb) display/i $pc

To see register values:

    (gdb) info reg

To step to the next instruction:

    (gdb) stepi

When GDB attaches, the target execution is halted, to continue execution:

    (gdb) cont

To set a breakppoint (tab completion on the function name should work):

    (gdb) break c_function_name

To set a breakpoint at an address:

    (gdb) break *0x80000000

To set a breakpoint at line 123 in file `file.c`:

    (gdb) break file.c:123

To continue after a breakpoint:

    (gdb) cont

To end debugging session, detach from gdb with:

    (gdb) detach

## Debugging target code running in ZeBu emulator with ARM DevStudio IDE

To debug in the ARM Development Studio IDE, you will need a license for the
IDE, and remote desktop access with GUI to the Synopsys Cloud, aka. the ZeBU
server (e.g.  via VNC). Note that via X forwarding over SSH, the IDE GUI is
unusably slow (at least on OS X client).

### Optionally modify the target code to wait for debugger

First, if you would like to attach the debugger at some "early" point before
the boot of the target software finishes, then enable a wait loop that is
very early in ATF, by enabling the `WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER` make flag (must
shallow-clean first, because make flags don't participate in the dependency
tree).

    $ make ssw/prof/PROFILE/bld/clean
    $ make WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=1 ssw/prof/PROFILE/run/zebu

This loop waits on a memory location pointed to by `__debugger_attached_ptr`
to become non-zero. The later section in this document show how the bit can
be set from the debugger.

### Get U-boot relocation offset

Note that U-boot relocates itself, so to debug code after relocation (e.g. set
breakpoints), you have to load the debug binary into the debugger at an offset.
To get the offset, you need to enable debug output, and run the profile
(outside of debugger) to get the offset from U-boot's output on the UART.

In U-boot source code -- insert at the very top (before `#include` statements)
of `ssw/hpps/u-boot/common/board_f.c`:

	#define DEBUG 1

Then re-build U-boot, run the profile (without debugger), and look for a
debug message on the UART like the following:

    Relocation Offset is: 0x7f7c000

Note that changes to U-boot code may change this offset, so keep this debug
output enabled as you debug in the debugger, and keep an eye on the relocation
offset each time you run the the software in the debugger.

### Create an ARM DevStudio Workspace (do this only once per profile)

When ARM DS is launched for the first time (next section), it will ask to
create a workspace (or, to create a new workspace at any point, then use the
menu `File->Switch Workspace`).

Create the worspace in the profile directory (this way, paths to files that
we'll need to load are kept short), in the path below, replace PROFILE with the
name of the target software profile you are working with (usually starts with
`sys-...`):

    hpsc/ssw/prof/PROFILE/

### Launch ARM DevStudio IDE

Launch ARM DS on Synopsys server where ZeBu will run (replace `LICENSE_STRING`
with your license, and `PATH_TO_ARMDS` with the path where ARM DS is installed
on the server):

    $ export ARMLMD_LICENSE_FILE=LICENSE_STRING
    $ export PATH=PATH_TO_ARMDS:$PATH
    $ armds_ide

### Create Platform Configuration for the Chiplet (do this once per workspace)

1. In the menu, select: `File->New->Other...`
2. In the wizard, search for `Platform Configuration`
3. Select "Advanced platform detection or manual creation" and click Next.
4. Click "Create New Database" button
5. In the "Extension Database Name" texbox, provide the name: "chipletdb", and
   click Next.
6. In the "Platform Manufacturer", provide the name "Boeing", and in "Platform
   Name", provide the name "Chiplet"; and click Finish.
7. The Platform Configuration Editor (for Chiplet.sdf) should open
   automatically in the main pane.
8. In Autodetect tab, under Probe Connection, Connection Address select
   "SynopsysExample", and in the textbox on the left, enter "localhost".
9. In Autodetect tab, under Debug System, Clock Speed, select "20kHz".
10. In Probe Configuration tab, for Probe Type select "SynopsysExample".
11. In Probe Configuration tab, in the top list, ensure that  "ProbeMode" is
    set to "1 - JTAG", and that "SWJEnable" is set to False.
12. In a terminal on the same ZeBu sever where ARM DS IDE is running, launch
    the ZeBu emulator with the target software (see [section above](#Run a SSW
    stack profile on a target platform)).
13. In ARM DS IDE, in Platform Configuration Editor, in Autodetect tab, near
    the bottom, click "Autodetect Platform" button. Monitor progress in
    the Console pane (PCE Console), to open the pane enable in the menu:
    `Window->Show View->Console`. When successful, in Platform Configuration
    Editor on the left, the "Devices" tree should be populated.
14. In Project Explorer pane, navigate to `chipletdb->Boards->Boeing->Chiplet`,
    right-click `Chiplet.sdf` and click "Build Platform". In the dialog window
    that appears, named "This platform contains warnings", click "Debug Only".
    In the Console pane, upon success, the message will be printed: `Platform
    "Boeing - Chipet" built successfully.`.
15. In the menu, select `File->Save All`.
16. ARM DS IDE and ZeBu emulator must both be restarted before the debugger
    can be used, so Exit the IDE with, `File->Exit`.
17. In the shell where ZeBu is running, quit the ZeBu emulator, with `quit`
    command in the `zRci %` prompt.

### Create a Debug Configuration (do this once per SW component)

Debugging different software components may require different Debug
Configuration. Multiple Debug Configurations may be created within
the same workspace (and will use the same Platform Configuration, created
in the previous section). In the steps below, to debug ATF or U-boot on A53,
a configuration of type "Bare Metal Debug" is used; to debug the Linux kernel,
a configuration of type "Linux Kernel Debug" is used.

To create a new Debug Configuration:

1. In the menu, select `Run->Debug Configurations".
2. Provide a name for the configuration in the "Name" textbox: "chiplet-bm"
   (for a "Bare Metal Debug" configuration type) or "chiplet-linux" (for the
   "Linux Kernel" configuration type).
3. In Connection tab, for "Target Connection" select "SynopsysExample".
4. In Connection tab, under Select Target, in the list, search for "Chiplet".
   Expand "Boeing->Chiplet", and select the configuration type appropriate
   for the SW component you are about to debug (see above in this section),
   and select the core, usually the primary core: Cortex-A53_0.
5. In Connection tab, under Connections, in the Connection textbox, enter
   "localhost".
6. In the Debugger tab, under Run control, select "Connect only".
7. Click "Apply" button, then click "Close" button.

### Attach to ZeBu from ARM DevStudio IDE

Launch ARM DS IDE as described in the [Launch ARM DevStudio
IDE](#Launch-ARM-DevStudio-IDE).

Enable the "Debug Control" and "Commands" tool panes if not already shown, by
selecting the corresponding items in the list in the menu: `Window->Show View'.
In the "Debug Control" pane, you should see the `chiplet-bm` and/or
`chiplet-linux` debug configurations created in the previous section. If the
configuration does not appear in the list, open in menu `Run->Debug
Configurations` and in that window, the configuration should be in the list
on the left, select it, and after launching ZeBu (see below), click Debug
button.

Launch ZeBu with the target software (see [section above](#Run a SSW stack
profile on a target platform)).

In the 'Debug Control' pane, for debugging ATF and U-boot, select the
'chiplet-bm' configuration created in the above step; or, for debugging the
Linux kernel, select the 'chiplet-linux` configuration; and click on the
'Connect To Target' button. You can monitor the log in the 'Console' pane.

Once debugger succesfully attaches to ZeBu, the 'Commands' pane will accept
commands. The commands seem to be compatible with GDB commands.  The commands
given in this section are to be entered in the Command pane.

#### Troubleshooting attaching to ZeBu

If attaching fails (especially, if ZeBu was quit while ARM DS IDE was still
connected), check for stale resources on the ZeBu sever, and if any exist, exit
ARM DS IDE, and remove the stale resources, as shown below.

Check for semaphores:

    $ ipcs -s

If you see any under your username, then delete them with this command, where
you substitute `ID` with the number in the `semid` column in the output from
the above command:

    $ ipcrm -s ID

Also, remove these temporary files (if another user owns them, you'll have to
ask that user to remove the files):

    $ rm -f /tmp/VSTRM_SERVERD*

Also, check for any running processes named `rddidap_serverd` and kill them:

    $ pgrep rddidap_serverd
    $ killall -9 rddidap_serverd

Restart ARM DS IDE and ZeBu, and retry connecting.

### Address spaces

In the debugger there are separate address spaces, for each exception level and
security state. To refer to a specific address space in an address expression,
prefix it with a prefix of the form `EL[321]N?:` (given here in regular
expression syntax), where the optional `N` identifies the non-secure state.
So, to refer to an addresses in the following components use the following
prefixes:

* ATF: `EL3`
* U-boot: `EL2N`
* Linux kernel: `EL1N` (note: must use "Linux Kenel Debug" configuration)
* Userspace on Linux: `EL0` (note: not tested)

Note: The following instructions cover debugging ATF and U-boot (i.e.
bare-metal code without memory virtualization); debugging the Linux kernel or
userspace are a separate subject and has not been tested yet.

#### Interrupt execution

Halt the target execution using the Pause button in Debug Control pane,
or using the following command:

    interrupt

### Load executables

While the debugger is interrupted (see section above), you may load
debug info and symbols from multiple executable binaries. Use the
`file` command for the first executable and `add-symbol-file` for
additional executables, and always indicate the address space with
the offset, as shown below.

Load the ATF debug binary:

    file bld/hpps/atf/atf.dbg.elf EL3N:0x0

Load U-boot code before relocation (rarely needed):

    add-symbol-file bld/hpps/u-boot/u-boot.dbg.elf EL2N:0x0

Load the relocated U-Boot code to an offset obtained as described in [Get
U-boot relocation offset](#Get-U-boot-relocation-offset) section above:

    add-symbol-file bld/hpps/u-boot/u-boot.dbg.elf EL2N:0x7f7c000

If you setup up a busyloop in the above section, then set the flag for the
target to exist the busyloop:

    set *__debugger_attached_ptr=1

#### Create a script with commands for loading the executables

To not have to re-run the above commands each time you re-attach the debugger,
it is convenient to add the above four commands into a script. You can do this
via the IDE GUI, by opening the History pane (`Window->Show View->History`),
highlighting the commands in question, right-clicking, and choosing "Save
selected lines as sript" and saving into the Scripts view. Then, in Scripts
pane, you can select and run this script each time after you attach and
interrupt the debugger. You can also create the script file in the workspace
directory (`ssw/prof/PROFILE`, where `PROFILE` is the name of the profile you
are working on that starts with a `sys-....`), and add it into the Scripts
view.

### Breakpoints

To set a breakpoint by function name, the function will be resolved to an
address in the address space indicated when the binary was loaded with `file`
command:

    break hpsc_testing_setup

To set a breakpoint by an address in a given address space (or, if not
specified, then in the current address space in which the execution is
interrupted); for example, within ATF:

    break *EL3:0x800044fc

Note: With U-boot, be careful with breakpoints of software type, because
when a software breakpoints is inserted, it effectively modifies the
instructions. Relocation causes two potential problems with breakpoints
inserted before relocation (in terms of time of insertion): (1) the modified
instructions will be copied during relocation, which will break execution when
that modified instruction is reached in relocated code, and (2) if you set
the breakpoint only in relocated instance of the code, the modified
instruction will be overwritten by the copy performed during relocation,
rendering the breakpoint ineffective. To avoid these issues, use a hardware
breakpoint to interrupt after relocation, and insert (i.e. enable) software
breakpoints at that time (i.e. after the relocation).

Instead of relying on the debugger, you can also mlookup an address of a
relocated function (or lookup the function by relocated address) manually,
using the `nm` utility from the cross-compilation toolchain in a shell.
First lookup up the un-relocated static address and then add/subtract the
offset from it (see subsection above for how to get the relocation offset):

    $ cd ssw/prof/PROFILE
    $ aarch64-linux-gnu-nm bld/hpps/u-boot/u-boot.dbg.elf | grep mmu_setup

After setting breakpoints, continue execution on the target:

    cont

When a breakpoint is hit, both the Disassembly pane and the editor source code
window should be populated with the instructions and the source code, and the
current line in the source code should be highlighted. If the line is not
highlighted, check that the corresponding debug binary was loaded with the
`file` or `add-symbol-file` command. You may try reloading the binary with the
`file` comand.

### Detach the debugger from ZeBu

To dettach the debugger from ZeBu (always do this before quitting ZeBu):

    disconnect
